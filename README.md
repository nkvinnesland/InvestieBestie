InvestieBestie

Empowering New Investors

InvestieBestie is designed for individuals with no prior experience or education in investing. By simplifying complex financial concepts, this tool helps aspiring investors build confidence in navigating the stock market.

Project Overview

InvestieBestie calculates the Beta rating of different stocks—a measure of volatility relative to the market. To make this information more accessible, the program integrates OpenAI’s natural language processing capabilities to provide clear, concise summaries about what the Beta rating means for each stock.

Key Features:

	•	Beta Calculation: Analyzes and computes the Beta rating of stocks to help users understand market volatility.
	•	AI-Powered Insights: Summarizes Beta information in simple, user-friendly language using OpenAI.
	•	Beginner-Friendly Interface: Tailored for those new to investing, ensuring an easy and informative experience.

How It Works

	1.	Users input stock data or choose from a list of popular stocks.
	2.	The program calculates the stock’s Beta rating based on historical market data.
	3.	OpenAI generates a plain-English explanation of the Beta rating’s implications, empowering users with knowledge about potential risks and returns.

Libraries/Frameworks:
	•	Backend:
	•	Spring Boot: Java framework for building the backend RESTful API.
	•	Spring Data JPA: For interacting with the database (if applicable).
	•	Spring Web: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
	•	Frontend:
	•	React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
	•	Axios: For making API calls from React to the backend.
